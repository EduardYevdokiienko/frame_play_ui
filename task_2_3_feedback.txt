                2. What Felt Off in Terms of Functionality and UX

- The DOM structure felt messy and inconsistent — finding reliable locators wasn’t easy at all.
- Some elements on the page share the same `id`, which is not only against HTML standards but also
breaks automation — you don’t know which one is actually being selected.
- The calendar widget was the trickiest part. It includes hidden days from other months that still
match the selectors, which makes date selection unreliable.
- There’s no unified approach to using attributes — sometimes it’s `title`, sometimes `name`, sometimes
nothing at all. Because of that, it’s hard to use CSS selectors or Playwright’s built-in queries like
`getByRole` or `getByLabel`.

                3. Suggestions to Make Automation Easier

- Ideally, every interactive element should have a unique `id`. That would make automation way easier
and more stable.
- Make sure all `id`s are truly unique — especially in forms and the calendar.
- Use a consistent naming strategy for attributes like `title`, `name`, and `class` to avoid confusion.
- Fix the calendar so only the visible/selectable dates are actually present in the active DOM.
- Even better, consider adding attributes like `data-testid` or `data-qa` specifically for test automation.
